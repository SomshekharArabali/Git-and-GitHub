Basic Concepts
What is Git?
Git is a distributed version control system that helps you track changes in your code over time. It's installed locally on your computer and works offline.
Key Features:

Track file changes and history
Create branches for different features
Merge code from multiple contributors
Revert to previous versions
Works entirely offline

What is GitHub?
GitHub is a cloud-based platform that hosts Git repositories online. It provides additional collaboration tools and features beyond basic Git functionality.
Key Features:

Remote repository hosting
Collaboration tools (issues, pull requests)
Project management features
CI/CD integration
Social coding features

Can Git work without internet?
Yes ✅ - Git works completely offline. You only need internet when:

Cloning from remote repositories
Pushing changes to remote repositories
Pulling updates from remote repositories

Can we use GitHub without Git?
Yes, but with limitations - You can:

Upload files directly through GitHub's web interface
Edit files online
Create repositories

However, you lose:

Local version control
Advanced Git features
Efficient workflow management


Git Structure and Workflow
Git's Three-Stage Architecture
Working Directory → Staging Area → Local Repository → Remote Repository

Working Directory: Where you edit files
Staging Area (Index): Files ready for commit
Local Repository: Committed snapshots
Remote Repository: Shared repository (like GitHub)

Staging in Git Explained
The staging area is a middle layer between your working directory and repository commits.
Workflow:

Edit files in working directory
git add moves files to staging area
git commit saves staged files to repository

Why staging exists:

Review changes before committing
Commit only specific files
Create clean, logical commits


Essential Git Commands
Repository Initialization
bashgit init
What it does: Creates a hidden .git folder in your project directory, initializing a local Git repository.
Adding and Committing
bashgit add <filename>     # Stage specific file
git add .              # Stage all files
git commit -m "message" # Commit staged changes
Flow:

add → Stage files for commit
commit → Save snapshot to local repository
push → Upload commits to remote repository

Git Stash
bashgit stash              # Save uncommitted changes
git stash pop          # Restore stashed changes
git stash list         # View all stashes
What it does: Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes, allowing you to switch branches or pull updates safely. Think of it as a clipboard for your work-in-progress.
Cherry-Pick
bashgit cherry-pick <commit-hash>
What it does: Takes a specific commit from another branch and applies it to your current branch. Useful for:

Applying bug fixes across branches
Selective feature integration
Hotfix deployment


GitHub Features
Essential GitHub Commands/Functions
CommandPurposegit clone <url>Copy repository to local machinegit pullFetch and merge latest changesgit pushUpload local commits to remotegit forkCopy repository to your GitHub accountgit blame <file>See who wrote each line of code
GitHub Workflow

Fork → Copy repository to your account
Clone → Download to local machine
Branch → Create feature branch
Commit → Save changes locally
Push → Upload to your fork
Pull Request → Propose changes to original repo


Advanced Concepts
Git Log and Commit Hashes
bashgit log
git log --oneline
Commit Hash (SHA-1): A unique 40-character identifier for each commit.

Example: a1b2c3d4e5f6789012345678901234567890abcd
Ensures commit integrity
Used for referencing specific commits

.gitignore File
Purpose: Tells Git which files and folders to ignore during version control.
Common entries:
gitignore# Dependencies
node_modules/
*.log

# Environment files
.env
.env.local

# Build outputs
dist/
build/

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/
How it works:

Git reads .gitignore before staging files
Listed patterns are excluded from git add
Must be committed to take effect

Data Storage in Git
Location: .git folder (hidden directory in project root)
What's stored:

All commits and their metadata
Branch information
Configuration settings
Object database (blobs, trees, commits)
Refs and logs

Best Practices
Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive messages
Start with verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
Keep first line under 50 characters
Add details in body if needed

Branching Strategy

main/master → Production-ready code
develop → Integration branch
feature/* → New features
hotfix/* → Quick fixes

Repository Organization

Use meaningful .gitignore
Include comprehensive README
Add LICENSE file
Use consistent folder structure
Document setup and usage
